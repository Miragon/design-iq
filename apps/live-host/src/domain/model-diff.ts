/**
 * Element-level diff of two ModelGraphs — which elements a save touched.
 *
 * Feeds the agent presence (application/agent-presence.ts): after an AI
 * client saves a model, the elements it changed become its canvas SELECTION,
 * so co-editors see the outlines where the agent worked — the equivalent of
 * a human's cursor. Notation-agnostic on purpose: ModelGraph is the analysis
 * seam every extractor answers (bpmn, dmn, the Miragon notations), so the
 * same function covers all of them; the client renders outlines from ids it
 * finds in its own element registry and ignores the rest.
 *
 * Added and changed ids only — a removed element has nothing left to outline.
 * Pure: graphs in, ids out.
