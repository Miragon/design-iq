/**
 * RepoConnectionSource — the second provider seam (docs/multi-repo-architecture.md).
 *
 * GitProvider (ports/git-provider.ts) models the USER-credentialed half: OAuth,
 * permission gate, push, PR. THIS interface models the PLATFORM-credentialed
 * half: where the set of connected repositories comes from and how the server
 * clones them. GitHub implements it with the App mechanics (installations,
 * installation tokens, install picker, HMAC webhooks). GitLab has none of
 * those concepts — its source will be an OAuth application + explicit project
 * selection (or group access tokens) and X-Gitlab-Token webhooks — but the
 * registry and the API only ever talk to this interface.
