/**
 * GitHub App REST access (docs/multi-repo-architecture.md, B): the wire work —
 * fresh RS256 app JWT per request, GitHub media type, header merge — lives in
 * @designiq/github-app (same plumbing the control plane uses, so they can't
 * drift); this adapter pins the live-host user-agent.
 *
 * Installation tokens (1h, per-installation) are minted+cached by TokenService
 * (repos/token-minter.ts), which can act LOCALLY (app JWT here) or REMOTELY
 * (control plane) so a cell never needs the app key — see ADR 0002.
