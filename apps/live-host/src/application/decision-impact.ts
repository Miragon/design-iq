/**
 * The decision half of a release PR: what the shipped `.dmn` files actually
 * DECIDE differently now.
 *
 * A DMN diff is unreadable — reordered rules, renamed ids, a `>=` that became
 * a `>`. So instead of diffing XML, this runs the decision's own test cases
 * against BOTH versions (origin/<default> and the workspace) and reports the
 * cases whose outcome moved. That table is the review a business reader can
 * actually do, and it is derived from the same engine the modeler simulates
 * with, so it cannot flatter the change.
 *
 * Everything here degrades quietly: no previous version (a new decision), no
 * test cases, no `fileAtCommit` on the injected workspace manager → the
 * section shrinks or disappears. A release must never fail because its
 * commentary could not be produced.
