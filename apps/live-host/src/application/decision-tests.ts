/**
 * The decision-test sidecar as a platform use-case: read it, run it, write it.
 *
 *   processes/rabatt.dmn
 *   processes/rabatt.tests.yaml   ← `<stem>.tests.yaml`, next to the model
 *
 * Reads and writes go through the SAME live-document path as the models
 * (content.ts): the sidecar is a `.yaml`, which the notation registry already
 * lists as an editable document — so it syncs, diffs, and ships in the release
 * PR alongside the `.dmn` it belongs to. Nothing here knows about git.
 *
 * The one thing that cannot go through putContent is the FIRST write: a live
 * document must exist on disk before it can be opened. A missing sidecar is
 * therefore created scaffold-style (a guarded direct write into the workspace
 * tree), after which every further save is a normal compare-and-set.
