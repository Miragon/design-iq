/**
 * The ONE repo authorization gate for the request-scoped transports (REST +
 * MCP): registry lookup, then the per-(user,repo) write check — ADR 0001's
 * provider-native authz. Both routers used to carry a private copy of this
 * rule ("the tool-level mirror of api.ts repoOf"); 24 call sites now share
 * this audited one, so a change to the security boundary happens exactly once.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the WebSocket entrance (collab.ts): its lookup is the
 * room-based splitRoom (longest registry prefix, canonical casing, suspension)
 * — only the denial WORDING is shared there. A LIVE_AUTH=none host needs no
 * branch here either: its injected `access` allows everything (auth/none.ts).
