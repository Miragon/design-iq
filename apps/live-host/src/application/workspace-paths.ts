/**
 * Symlink guard for filesystem writes into a workspace: lexical path checks
 * are blind to symlinks — a previously created folder could be replaced by a
 * link pointing outside, and a write would then land through it. Canonicalize
 * the nearest EXISTING ancestor (that is where the write physically lands)
 * and require it to stay inside the canonical workspace. Was a verbatim
 * private copy in scaffold.ts and decision-tests.ts; the wire-visible error
 * code stays per caller. (collab.ts keeps its own weaker inline form on the
 * ws path — plain Error, existing-target-only — deliberately untouched here.)
