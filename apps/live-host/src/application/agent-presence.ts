/**
 * Agent presence — AI clients show up in a room's awareness like a co-editor.
 *
 * The MCP write path never joins a room: every tool call opens a server-side
 * direct connection, transacts and disconnects within milliseconds, and the
 * /mcp transport is stateless — so from a co-editor's perspective an agent
 * editing the model was invisible (no roster avatar, no cursor). This module
 * gives each (room, principal) an awareness LEASE: a model-touching tool call
 * `touch`es it, the lease publishes a presence state (kind "agent", named
 * after the person the agent acts for, the elements its last save changed as
 * the selection) into the room's awareness, and it expires TTL after the last
 * touch — a removal every client sees.
 *
 * Mechanics: one private y-protocols Awareness per lease (its own Y.Doc, so
 * its own clientID) whose every update is re-encoded into the room's
 * awareness — the room broadcasts it to every ws client exactly like a
 * peer's state, and Hocuspocus sends the current states to whoever connects
 * later. The private instance's own re-announce (every ~15 s, y-protocols)
 * rides the same path, which keeps the state alive past the clients' 30 s
 * outdated-purge. `awarenessOf` answers only for a LOADED room (someone has
 * it open): nobody in the room means nobody to show the agent to — and no
 * document is ever pinned live for the sake of a presence marker.
 *
 * Never in the Y.Doc (presence is ephemeral — the live contract). kind
 * "agent" is asserted HERE and stripped from every ws-originated state in
 * collab.ts, so a browser peer cannot pose as an agent.
