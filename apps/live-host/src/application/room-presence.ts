 * Room presence read-model — who is in a model's live room right now, for the

 * pointer) and the AI clients acting in it (application/agent-presence.ts).
 *
 * The identity behind a peer comes from the SERVER, never from the payload:
 * Hocuspocus records which ws connection announced which awareness clientId,
 * and the connection carries the user onAuthenticate admitted. That is what
 * makes `you` trustworthy — the caller's own human presence, the person the
 * agent acts for — so "the element I selected" resolves to a real selection.
 *
 * Reads a LOADED document only (server.ts composes peersOf over
 * hocuspocus.documents): an unloaded room has nobody in it by definition, and
 * answering must never load one.
