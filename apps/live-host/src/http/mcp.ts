/**
 * The Live Host's MCP endpoint — AI clients talk to the LIVE platform state
 * through the same application use-cases the REST routes call, in-process.
 * Mounted at POST /mcp by api.ts (which authenticates first: session id, dev
 * token or OIDC JWT — one auth surface for humans and agents).
 *
 * Stateless Streamable HTTP on the official SDK, one fresh McpServer per
 * request (the pattern of packages/mcp/http.ts): tools close over the CALLER's
 * session, so per-repo authorization runs per tool call — there is no warm
 * state a different principal could ever be handed.
 *
 * Write path: save_bpmn_xml REQUIRES the baseVersion from a prior get — the
 * compare-and-set lives in application/content.ts; a stale token returns the
 * current XML as a retryable result (not an error), so agents re-derive and
 * retry. All validation (BPMN structure, BPMNDI coverage, size cap) is
 * enforced server-side in the use-case, never only here.
 *
 * Todos (list/create/close) ride the IssueTracker port — model-anchored work
 * items live in the customer's OWN tracker, never in a platform database. The
 * tools register only when the platform HAS tracker credentials, so an agent's
 * tools/list tells it the truth instead of failing at call time.
 *
 * LIVE_MCP_READONLY=1 (opts.mcpReadOnly) registers no write tools at all —
 * absent from tools/list, not erroring (agents plan against reality).
