# Live Collaboration — MVP

The designIQ Live Host: live sync for the models of every notation, the REST API, the web app
and the `/mcp` endpoint for AI clients, on one port. This README records how it was built and
verified; to operate it, see [docs/on-prem/](../../docs/on-prem/).

**Status: pitchable MVP** (2026-07-08). One `pnpm live-host` (monorepo root) runs
everything on **one port**: HTTP API + built web app + WebSocket sync share
http://localhost:8301 (Hocuspocus rides the same server via upgrade — behind Fly this is
a single TLS endpoint). The web app is a real collaborative BPMN modeler (bpmn-js canvas +
Monaco XML on one shared Y.Text, presence avatars), and **Release → PR** turns the live
state of a process into a validated GitHub pull request — merge = approval, the pipeline
redeploys portal + MCP.

Verified end to end (all self-tested, see git history for the harnesses):

- canvas co-modeling, two real browser tabs, both directions, ~370 ms: **9/9 PASS**
- release flow against the real repo: PR created, CI validate green (pre-split, private history)
- VS Code (Miragon modeler on `bpm-live://`, today `designiq://`): **6/6 PASS** <!-- legacy-name-ok: the scheme of that run -->
- Yjs lineage survives server restarts (SQLite persistence in `.live/live.db`): **PASS** —
  this fix came from a live-observed bug where a restart + reconnecting client duplicated
  every character of the document
- known limit (documented, accepted for MVP): text-level sync can drop one of two edits that
  collide inside the ~10 ms `importXML` window — operation-level sync is the v2 answer;
  local edits always win over remote imports (600 ms quiet period + deferred re-export)

## Multi-repo (implemented 2026-07-08)

One Live Host serves **many repositories** (docs/multi-repo-architecture.md). The connected
set derives from the GitHub App's **installations** (app JWT → installation enumeration,
webhook receiver at `POST /webhook/github`, fallback: the host's own repo when no app
private key is configured). The web app opens with a **repo overview** (`GET /api/repos`,
filtered per user permission, with the person's favorites and recently opened repositories —
`PUT`/`DELETE /api/me/favorites/<owner>/<repo>`, `PUT /api/me/recent/<owner>/<repo>`);
rooms are **`<owner>/<repo>/<path>`**; every repo gets its
own workspace (`.live/workspaces/<owner>/<repo>`, cloned on demand with installation
tokens — the host's own repo keeps using this checkout). A repo is a content repo when it
has a root **`designiq.yml`** (legacy `bpmiq.yml` still read) naming its models folder; a
model is a file with a registered notation extension under it (a process its `.bpmn`).
Releases are repo-scoped (`POST /api/repos/:owner/:repo/release/:id`) and publish that
file's live state as a PR.
Requires in `.env` (from `pnpm create-app` in this directory): `GITHUB_APP_ID` + the app
private key — via any of (first match wins):
`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (paste the raw PEM straight into `.env`, wrapped in double quotes —
multi-line is fine), `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/app.pem`,
`GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` (base64 one-liner), or just drop the downloaded `.pem` into
`apps/live-host/` (auto-detected; `.env` and `*.pem` are gitignored).
(+ `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for live webhooks.)
Verified: 13-check browser E2E incl. same-process-id-in-two-repos isolation (no
cross-repo bleed) and per-(user,repo) authorization.

## Todos — model-anchored work items in the repo's own tracker

`GET/POST /api/repos/:fullName/todos` (+ `POST …/todos/:id/close`) stores todos as **GitHub
Issues in the content repo** (label `todo` + `process:<id>`, the anchor block from
`@designiq/contracts/todo-anchor` embedded in the issue body) — never in a platform database.
The MCP twins are `list_todos` / `create_todo` / `close_todo` (below), so agents and the
embedded modeler widget file and complete the same items humans see in the web app. Reads
return the author's own text (`body`) with that platform markup stripped again — it is what
the modeler widget's "Implement" prompt hands to the assistant.
Issue bodies deep-link every anchored element straight into the web app's process editor
(`📍 <PUBLIC_URL>/r/<owner>/<repo>/p/<process>?element=<id>`). Issues are created with the app
installation token (bot-authored, the human is attributed in the body — same model as
releases; a close posts the attribution comment first); without platform credentials the
routes answer 501. Requires the GitHub App permission
**Issues: Read and write** (in the `create-app` manifest since the todo feature): apps
registered earlier must add the permission in the app settings, and **existing installations
must approve the added permission** (GitHub prompts the org owner) before todos work — until
then the API returns a clear 403 explaining exactly that.

## MCP endpoint + live content API

`POST /mcp` (official MCP TypeScript SDK v2, stateless Streamable HTTP) serves the
tools over the **live** models: `list_repos`, `list_models`, `get_view`, `list_processes`,
`get_process`, `get_bpmn_xml`, `validate_bpmn`, `list_changes`, the modeler widgets
`open_modeler` / `open_decision_modeler` / `open_wardley_modeler` /
`open_team_topology_modeler` / `open_event_storming_modeler` / `open_context_map_modeler` (+ their internal
`mint_ws_ticket` — see [apps/web/README.md](../web/README.md)), `create_process`,
`save_bpmn_xml`, `release_process`, the
notation-generic `get_model_content` / `validate_model` / `create_model` / `save_model_content` — plus
`list_todos` / `create_todo` / `close_todo` **when a tracker is configured** (no
credentials → absent from `tools/list`, never a call that fails). The repo is a **tool
argument**, not a URL segment; every call runs
through the same per-(user,repo) authorization as the rest of the API, and `save_bpmn_xml`
is compare-and-set — it requires the `baseVersion` from a prior `get_bpmn_xml`, and a
stale one returns a retryable `{conflict: true, currentContent}`. `LIVE_MCP_READONLY=1`
registers no write tools at all. Non-MCP clients use the REST twins:
`GET/PUT /api/repos/:owner/:repo/content?path=<model path>` — GET returns
`{repo, path, content, baseVersion}`; PUT requires `{content, baseVersion}` (the pre-#154 `xml`
key is still accepted and emitted as a deprecated alias for one release), validates the
notation via `@miragon/design-iq-validator` (ERROR findings → 422, WARN returned as warnings), enforces
the doc size cap (413), and CASes (stale `baseVersion` → 409 with the current state). Writes land
in the live Y.Text (the `@designiq/live-client/text` minimal-diff writer over a Hocuspocus
direct connection), so every open editor sees them instantly — git is only reached through
the release-as-PR flow. Full doc: docs/mcp-integration.md; decision record:

| Env                     | Default           | Meaning                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LIVE_OIDC_ISSUER`      | —                 | IdP issuer URL — set together with `LIVE_OIDC_JWKS_URL` to accept OIDC bearer JWTs.        |
| `LIVE_OIDC_JWKS_URL`    | —                 | IdP JWKS endpoint for token signature verification.                                        |
| `LIVE_OIDC_AUDIENCE`    | `LIVE_PUBLIC_URL` | Required `aud` of accepted tokens.                                                         |
| `LIVE_OIDC_LOGIN_CLAIM` | `github_login`    | Claim carrying the IdP-verified GitHub login; a token without it is refused (fail closed). |
| `LIVE_MCP_READONLY`     | —                 | `1` = register no MCP write tools (absent from `tools/list`, not erroring).                |

## Authentication — the IdP authenticates, the GitHub App authorizes

**Login authenticates, repos authorize** ([ADR 0007](../../docs/adr/0007-idp-only-login-and-no-auth-mode.md)):
people sign in at the identity provider — the OIDC browser login (`src/auth/oidc-login.ts`,
code + PKCE) for the web app and editors, audience-bound bearer JWTs (`src/auth/oidc.ts`)
for MCP and headless clients, ONE identity contract for both. The session is identity-only
(httpOnly cookie for the API, session id as websocket token); per-(user,repo) write
permission is checked at request/room-join time (5-min cache) app-side with the GitHub
App's installation token — the overview only shows repos the user may work on. Releases
push and open the PR **bot-authored with the human as git author**
([ADR 0001](../../docs/adr/0001-zero-stored-user-tokens.md)) — merge rights stay at the
provider (CODEOWNERS/branch protection). No user token is obtained or stored, anywhere.

### GitHub — one vendor app, users only see the install picker

**Vendor step, once ever** (Miragon / the instance operator):
`pnpm --filter @designiq/live-host create-app` — a guided page creates the central
**GitHub App** (proposed name "designIQ <org>") under the org that owns the content repo
(requires being signed in as org owner); credentials land automatically in
`apps/live-host/.env`. Never touched again.

**User flow, forever after**: sign in at the IdP → repo not connected yet? The screen offers
**"Repository verbinden"** → GitHub's own **install picker** (choose org + repository) →
GitHub bounces to `/setup/installed`, the new repos appear. No app creation, no tokens, no
secrets for users. The gate stays: write permission on the content repository (checked
app-side via `collaborators/permission`) is the entry ticket.

Decision history: a per-instance app wizard, a per-user PAT login and the GitHub OAuth
login itself were each built, verified, and retired (git history; ADR 0007 for the last).
`GITHUB_BASE_URL`/`GITHUB_API_URL` still point everything at GitHub Enterprise or
`test/stub-provider.ts` (offline).

### GitLab — architecture carries it, implementation deferred

The `GitProvider` interface models the release half (push URL, PR/MR creation on the
platform credential); the `RepoConnectionSource` interface the connection half (project
enumeration, tokens, per-user permission). A GitLab port implements both. An early GitLab
draft of the old user-OAuth shape exists in git history (`08b6c20` era).

### Identity providers — pure configuration, by design

Any OIDC-conformant IdP (Keycloak, Entra ID, WorkOS AuthKit, …) can BE the login — it must
issue the git-provider login claim (`github_login`), because identity is not authorization:
repository access always requires the git provider's own permission, resolved app-side.
Recipe: [docs/extending/mcp-idp-setup.md](../../docs/extending/mcp-idp-setup.md); seam:
[docs/extending/sso.md](../../docs/extending/sso.md).

### Headless clients & offline demos

- `LIVE_AUTH=none` runs the host **without authentication**
  ([ADR 0007](../../docs/adr/0007-idp-only-login-and-no-auth-mode.md)): every request, ws
  join and MCP call is the local principal (`LIVE_LOCAL_USER`, else the OS user), every
  registered repository is writable, nothing to sign in to. Tests, the guest script and the
  VS Code extension's local mode run on it (a signed-in person uses the editor sign-in
  instead: `?editor=` on the login routes + `POST /auth/exchange`, `src/http/editor-login.ts`,
  `apps/vscode/README.md`). It replaced the dev token (`LIVE_DEV_TOKEN` is refused at
  startup) and is never inferred: an `oidc`-mode host without a login refuses to start.
- **OIDC bearer JWTs**: with `LIVE_OIDC_ISSUER` + `LIVE_OIDC_JWKS_URL`
  configured, `Authorization: Bearer <IdP JWT>` (audience-bound; the login claim must
  carry the IdP-verified GitHub login) authenticates `/mcp` and the REST routes — per-repo
  authorization still runs app-side via `checkUserPermission`. Caveat: for a JWT session
  the `wsToken` returned by `/api/me` is a synthetic id — NOT usable to open the
  websocket.
- `test/stub-provider.ts` fakes GitHub's OAuth+REST endpoints (plus a `_control` endpoint for
  the permission gate) — full login/release flow without internet, also used by the E2E.

## Original M0 spike notes (Hocuspocus)

Proves the core of [the platform concept](../../docs/platform-concept.md) after the
**Hocuspocus pivot** (see the concept's revision note): the Live Host is a Hocuspocus server —
sync server and workspace service in one process, the server _is_ the host. One Y.Doc per
model file, room name = repo-relative path, Y.Text field `content`.

**Exit criterion (met, twice): two clients co-edit `order-to-cash.bpmn` through the Live Host.**

## Why Hocuspocus (spike evidence)

The same four-assertion test ran against both candidate stacks:

|                         | OCT + headless bot host                                 | **Hocuspocus (chosen)**                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| initial sync            | 10 014 ms first guest (seed race, saved by 10 s resync) | **0 ms** — `onLoadDocument` seeds before the sync response   |
| co-edit round trip      | 27 ms                                                   | **12 ms**                                                    |
| write-through           | 285 ms (own debounce)                                   | 2 002 ms (built-in `onStoreDocument` debounce, configurable) |
| processes needed        | relay + bot host                                        | **one server**                                               |
| persistence, auth hooks | built by us against session semantics                   | **native hooks** (`onAuthenticate`, `onStoreDocument`)       |
| VS Code side            | extension for free (but no custom-editor sync)          | thin own extension (~150 lines, `apps/vscode/`)              |

OCT remains the right tool if developers should live-share _arbitrary_ workspace files;
for "web modeler + live model access from VS Code" the server-authoritative model wins.
The OCT variant is preserved in git history (the pre-monorepo spike tree).

## Run it

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 23.6, pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install                     # monorepo root

# Terminal 1 — the Live Host (HTTP + WebSocket on http://localhost:8301)
LIVE_AUTH=none pnpm live-host   # local evaluation: no login (ADR 0007)

# Terminal 2 — automated exit-criterion test (two headless guests)
pnpm --filter @designiq/live-host test:sync

# MCP smoke test against the running host (LIVE_AUTH=none: no token; else SMOKE_TOKEN=<token>)
node apps/live-host/scripts/mcp-smoke.mjs [mcpUrl] [repo]

# Web client (dev server with hot reload; the Live Host serves the built app)
pnpm web:dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```

## Measured results (2026-07-07, localhost)

```
PASS  initial sync matches disk — alice 0ms, bob 0ms
PASS  co-edit round trip alice→server→bob: 12ms
PASS  live host persisted to the working tree after 2002ms (hocuspocus debounce)
PASS  reverse-direction edit synced and persisted — working tree clean
```

## Self-tested end to end (2026-07-07)

**Browser E2E** (Playwright, two real Chromium tabs + one headless guest):

```
PASS  two browser tabs joined and loaded the BPMN content
PASS  tab1 keyboard edit visible in tab2 after 1ms
PASS  headless guest received the browser edit
PASS  node-guest edit visible in both tabs after 4ms
PASS  both edits persisted to the working tree
PASS  cleanup synced everywhere, working tree clean
```

(Remote-cursor DOM decorations were not asserted: Monaco virtualizes lines, so a cursor
outside the viewport has no DOM node — content sync and awareness are what matter.)

**VS Code E2E** (`pnpm test:e2e` in `apps/vscode/` — real VS Code via
@vscode/test-electron, Miragon BPMN Modeler v1.3.0 installed into the test instance):

```
PASS  virtual document content equals working tree
PASS  remote edit auto-applied to open document after 50ms
PASS  local edit+save reached the remote guest after 0ms
PASS  Miragon BPMN Modeler opened the bpm-live:// document (custom-editor tab active)   # legacy-name-ok: verbatim log
PASS  remote edit propagated while the custom editor is open
PASS  cleanup: working tree clean
```

The concept's load-bearing assumptions are hereby verified programmatically: VS Code
auto-reverts non-dirty virtual documents on our `FileChangeType.Changed` events, and the
Miragon custom editor opens the extension's live documents (`designiq://` since 5.0) and
keeps receiving remote changes.
Two open observations for the eyeball test (the only thing code can't see — pixels):
the test asserts the custom-editor _tab_, not the rendered canvas, and the test log showed
one webview css load error (possibly an artifact of the sandboxed test `--extensions-dir`).

Run the eyeball test: `cd apps/vscode && pnpm compile`, F5 (or
`code --extensionDevelopmentPath=$PWD`), then _designIQ: Open Live Model_ while the web
client is open — watch the canvas follow the browser edits.

## Spike shortcuts (M1 turns these into the real thing)

- Auth = shared token; M1: WorkOS/GitHub JWT in `onAuthenticate`, user context into awareness.
- Write-through targets the developer checkout; M1: dedicated clone + debounced commits onto
  the tenant's draft branch, release flow (M2) unchanged from the concept.
- VS Code `writeFile` replaces the full Y.Text and remote updates rely on VS Code re-reading
  non-dirty files; M1: minimal-diff writes + `WorkspaceEdit`-based live binding for open
  documents (the pattern OCT's extension uses, verified in its source).
- The web client binds Monaco (text). The bpmn-js canvas with the concept's four sync rules
  is the first M1 deliverable — it binds to the same Y.Text.
