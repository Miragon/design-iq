# @designiq/web

The collaborative web client of designIQ — the SPA (bpmn-js / dmn-js / the Miragon
renderers + Monaco on a shared Y.Text, the repo overview) **and** the MCP-App
modeler widgets the Live Host serves inline in AI chats (claude.ai, Claude
Desktop, ChatGPT).

## Scripts

| Script                                  | What it does                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm --filter @designiq/web dev`       | Vite dev server: the SPA, and every widget at `/mcp-app*.html` (raw boot marker → editable, this origin as the deep-link base). |
| `pnpm --filter @designiq/web build`     | The SPA plus **one single-file bundle per widget** into `dist/` (`vite build`, then `scripts/build-widgets.ts`, see below).     |
| `pnpm --filter @designiq/web test`      | `node --test test/*.test.ts` — the DOM-free widget-core suites (lifecycle, live upgrade, engines).                              |
| `pnpm --filter @designiq/web typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` over `src/` and `test/`.                                                                                         |

## The MCP-App widgets

Each widget is ONE self-contained HTML file (`dist/mcp-app*.html`: scripts, CSS
and, for bpmn/dmn, the icon font inlined) built by `vite.widget.config.ts`'s
factory; `scripts/build-widgets.ts` runs every build. The Live Host
(`apps/live-host/src/http/mcp.ts`) serves it as a `ui://` resource behind an
`open_*` tool — a dist without a bundle simply lacks that tool.

| Bundle                        | Tool                          | Engine                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `mcp-app.html`                | `open_modeler`                | bpmn-js (+ stickies, t.BPM, todos)      |
| `mcp-app-dmn.html`            | `open_decision_modeler`       | dmn-js + simulation (+ the tests panel) |
| `mcp-app-wardley.html`        | `open_wardley_modeler`        | `@miragon/wardley-renderer`             |
| `mcp-app-team-topology.html`  | `open_team_topology_modeler`  | `@miragon/team-topologies-renderer`     |
| `mcp-app-event-storming.html` | `open_event_storming_modeler` | `@miragon/event-storming-renderer`      |
| `mcp-app-context-map.html`    | `open_context_map_modeler`    | `@miragon/context-maps-renderer`        |

**One lifecycle.** Every widget shares `src/mcp-app/core/`: `lifecycle.ts`
(tool input → load via `get_model_content` → engine → debounced CAS autosave via
`save_model_content` with `lint:"warn"` → the conflict banner → the newest-widget
claim → the progressive live upgrade → the post-outage reconcile), `live.ts` (the
single-use ws ticket + Yjs session) and `widget.ts` (the DOM composition:
`bootWidget(spec)`). A notation contributes an **engine adapter**
(`src/mcp-app/engines/*.ts`) against the contract in `core/engine.ts` —
`importText` / `exportText` / `onDirty` / optional `selectedElementId` /
optional `bindLive` — plus a `WidgetSpec` (`main.ts` for bpmn, `dmn-main.ts`
for dmn). Two engine invariants the core relies on: `importText` never fires
`onDirty` (the Miragon DSL renderers emit `commandStack.changed` from their own
`clear()` — `engines/miragon.ts` suppresses the echo), and `bindLive` is a
capability (absent = CAS autosave only — the dmn engine's deliberate mode).
Full behaviour: [docs/mcp-integration.md](../../docs/mcp-integration.md).

**One spec per Miragon renderer.** The four Miragon widgets are not four
entries: `src/notations/miragon/<id>.ts` holds ONE `MiragonRendererSpec` per
renderer (package, css classes, a lazy `load()` yielding Modeler + viewer +
the text lane), and everything derives from it — the SPA's editor plugin
(`notations/miragon/plugin.ts`), the widget engine (`engines/miragon.ts` over
`@designiq/live-client/miragon-sync`), the vendor-CSS scoping in `vite.config.ts`,
and the widget bundle: `mcp-app-miragon.html` + `src/mcp-app/miragon-main.ts`
are the ONE template + entry, built once per spec with the spec aliased in
through `@/mcp-app/widget-spec` (`miragonWidgetConfig`) and emitted as
`mcp-app-<id>.html`. The dev server resolves that alias to
`widget-spec.dev.ts`: `/mcp-app-miragon.html?notation=<id>` previews any of them.

**One engine per bundle.** The iframe sandbox allows no external requests, so
nothing is shared between the emitted files — and exactly one engine per file is
also the widgets' whole CSS scoping: the SPA's postcss vendor-CSS scoping is
deliberately absent here. Never bundle two engines (or bpmn-js next to a Miragon
sheet) into one widget.

**Read-only hosts** (`LIVE_MCP_READONLY=1` on the Live Host) mount each engine's
`NavigatedViewer`; for the DSL-lane renderers (wardley, event storming) with an
inert `commandStack` value module (`engines/diagram-js.ts` — their import clears
a stack only the Modeler registers).

### Adding a Miragon notation

1. The descriptor in `@designiq/notations` (extensions, noun, media kind).
2. One spec file `src/notations/miragon/<id>.ts` (copy `wardley.ts` for a DSL
   renderer, `team-topology.ts` for a JSON one) and its line in
   `src/notations/miragon/index.ts` — the SPA editor plugin, the widget engine,
   the CSS scoping and the widget bundle derive from it.
3. The notation id in `GENERATED_WIDGET_NOTATIONS` (`apps/live-host/src/http/mcp.ts`)
   — the tool, its description and its resource derive from the registry
   descriptor (`@designiq/contracts/mcp-app` names the tool) and the test stubs
   follow `WIDGET_FILES`; the two literal tool-list pins in
   `apps/live-host/test/mcp.test.ts` gain the new name (on purpose — a new tool
   shows up in a reviewed diff).
4. `docs/mcp-integration.md` (tool table + the widgets section).

A renderer with a different API than the two lanes (or a non-Miragon engine)
gets a bespoke engine adapter + entry, the bpmn/dmn way — until
[#136](https://github.com/Miragon/design-iq/issues/136) (`@miragon/modeler-api`)
makes the lane split disappear.

### Mixed deployments

The widgets and the Live Host ship in one image. A web dist newer than a
pre-#160 Live Host has no `get_model_content` and fails its first load with
"Tool get_model_content not found" — there is no fallback on purpose.
