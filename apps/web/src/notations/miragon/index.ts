/**
 * The Miragon renderer registry — the web-side twin of @designiq/notations for
 * the notations whose editor is a Miragon modeler: ONE spec per renderer,
 * everything else derives (see ./spec.ts for the four consumers). Adding a
 * Miragon notation = its descriptor in @designiq/notations + one spec file here
 * (named `<id>.ts`, exporting `spec` — the widget build aliases it in by id)
 * + the id in the Live Host's widget list (apps/live-host/src/http/mcp.ts).
 *
 * Node-loadable on purpose (scripts/build-widgets.ts and vite.config.ts
 * import it): relative `.ts` imports, no "@/" alias, nothing DOM-bound at
 * module level — the engines load behind each spec's `load()`.
