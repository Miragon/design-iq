/**
 * The Miragon renderer spec — the ONE object per notation whose editor is a
 * Miragon modeler (the diagram-js renderers built from the modeler template:
 * Wardley Maps, Team Topologies, Event Storming, Context Maps). Everything
 * the platform needs to host such a renderer derives from it:
 *
 *   ./plugin.ts               → the web editor plugin (WebNotationPlugin)
 *   ../../mcp-app/engines/miragon.ts → the MCP-App widget engine
 *   ../../../vite.config.ts   → the SPA's vendor-CSS scoping (pkg + vendorRoot)
 *   ../../../scripts/build-widgets.ts → one single-file widget bundle per spec
 *
 * The eager part is DATA (id, package, css classes); the renderer, its
 * stylesheet and its text lane ride behind `load()` — the engine chunk loads
 * on mount in the SPA, and is inlined whole into the widget bundle. What
 * differs between the renderers is their text lane (@designiq/live-client
 * miragon-sync MiragonLane); issue #136 (@miragon/modeler-api) retires that
 * split upstream, after which a spec is `{ id, pkg, css, load }` alone.
