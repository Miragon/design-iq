/**
 * The widget's MCP side: the ext-apps App handshake and typed wrappers around
 * the Live-Host tools it calls through the host bridge. App-initiated
 * tools/call rides the host's authenticated connection to POST /mcp — the same
 * per-call authorization as agent calls, no credential in the iframe.
 *
 * Tool results arrive as JSON in the first text content block (the `ok()`
 * helper in apps/live-host/src/http/mcp.ts) — parsed here, typed via the
 * shared wire contracts so server drift breaks the build, not the widget.
 *
 * Every widget reads and saves through the notation-generic
 * get_model_content / save_model_content (the widget core, core/widget.ts);
 * the decision widget adds the test-suite tools. Not every tool exists on
 * every host: the todo tools are absent without a configured tracker (and the
 * write ones in read-only mode), exactly like mint_ws_ticket. There is no
 * tools/list over the app bridge, so absence is detected on the first call —
 * `isMissingTool` separates "capability absent" (hide the UI) from a real
 * tracker error (show it; those messages are actionable).
