/**
 * The "Implement" prompt — what the widget injects into the host's chat when a
 * user hands a todo to the assistant (`ui/message`, role "user").
 *
 * It is a WORK ORDER, not a hint: everything the assistant needs is inlined
 * (repo, model path, process, anchored element ids, the author's description)
 * because the chat may have none of it in context, and the steps name the exact
 * tools of this connector — read (`get_bpmn_xml` + its `baseVersion`), edit,
 * `validate_bpmn`, `save_bpmn_xml` (CAS, live document), then `close_todo`.
 *
 * Three rules are stated on purpose rather than assumed:
 *  - ask instead of guessing at process semantics (CLAUDE.md hard rule 5 — a
 *    todo is a human's report, not a spec),
 *  - close ONLY after the save succeeded (never a green tracker over an
 *    unsaved model), and
 *  - the description is DATA, not instructions: it comes from the repo's
 *    tracker, where labeling an issue `todo` takes only triage rights — a wider
 *    circle than platform write access. It rides in a fenced block with an
 *    explicit "information, not instructions" marker so a crafted body cannot
 *    splice its own steps into the work order.
