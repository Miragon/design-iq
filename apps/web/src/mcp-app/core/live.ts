/**
 * The live upgrade: mint a single-use ws ticket over the bridge, open the
 * SAME Hocuspocus/Yjs session the web SPA uses (openLiveSession + the
 * engine's own live-client binding), and hand the canvas over to CRDT sync —
 * remote edits appear live, local edits persist continuously, no autosave
 * round-trips.
 *
 * Strictly progressive: if the host CSP blocks the socket, the ticket tool is
 * absent (read-only host), or the sync never arrives, we resolve undefined and
 * the caller stays on the bridge-autosave path. The widget must never be
 * broken by a host that doesn't honour connectDomains.
 *
 * Two hooks keep the hand-over lossless: beforeBind flushes unsaved canvas
 * state BEFORE the first Yjs import replaces the canvas, and onDead reports a
 * post-upgrade death — the ticket is single-use, so the provider's automatic
 * reconnect re-sends a consumed token and can never re-authenticate; the
 * caller must re-mint a ticket or fall back to autosave.
 *
 * Moved from mcp-app/live.ts (#156): the App became an injected mint(), the
 * session opener is injectable (the node --test suite fakes the socket), and
 * the one bpmn-specific line — bindBpmn — became the engine's bindLive.
