/**
 * The ONE widget lifecycle — the BPMN widget's state machine (load → lazy
 * engine mount → dirty tracking → debounced CAS autosave → conflict banner →
 * newest-widget claim → progressive live upgrade → post-outage reconcile)
 * MOVED out of main.ts behind ports, so every canvas notation's widget runs
 * the same code (#156) and the node --test suite drives it without a DOM.
 * DOM-free: the only runtime import is roomName; `.ts`-extension relative
 * imports and no "@/" alias, or node cannot load it.
 *
 * The move is verbatim except for this substitution table (review the diff
 * with `git diff -M --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`):
 *  - the chrome DOM writes → ChromePort calls (setTitle / setStatus(+tooltip)
 *    / setDirty / setSaveButton / setOpenVisible / showBanner / hideBanner)
 *  - `modeler: ModelerHandle` → `engine: E`; `todos` → `extras` (WidgetExtras)
 *  - `ref: ProcessRef` → TWO latches: `input` (the tool input, set at load
 *    START — hasLoaded) and `ref: DocRef` (set only once the load's IMPORT
 *    has landed, cleared at load start). The types force it, and a save()
 *    racing a re-load — its bridge read OR its import — now bails on `!ref`
 *    instead of PUTting the old canvas against the incoming document.
 *  - getBpmnXml / saveBpmnXml / updateModelContext → bridge.load / save / saved
 *  - tryLive(app, ref, modeler, hooks) → deps.live(ref, engine, hooks), guarded
 *    by `engine.bindLive` (a capability) and the presence of a live port
 *  - claimDocument → deps.claim; AUTOSAVE_MS / 10_000 / 100 → deps.timing
 *  - liveHooks gains onImportError (the DSL/JSON binds report it; bpmn never)
 *  - `cfg.readonly`, the deep link, the icon font and the button handlers
 *    live in widget.ts (the DOM composition)
 * Four re-delivery hazards the old code carried are closed here (each pinned
 * by a test): flushForLive is epoch-fenced, so a stale live upgrade never
 * binds the previous document's room onto the canvas of a newer load; a
 * re-load that found the previous upgrade still connecting re-attempts its
 * own once that settles; the autosave timer of an edit racing a re-load's
 * import is cleared when the import lands; and a re-delivery after a
 * supersede is ignored. A load whose import rejects keeps the deep link
 * (the read landed) and disables the Save button — the canvas it left is
 * not the document it names.
 * Everything else is unchanged on purpose — latch names and order, every
 * `epoch !== liveEpoch || inactive` re-check after an await, clearTimeout
 * BEFORE the scheduleAutosave gate, autosavePaused + clearTimeout BEFORE the
 * conflict banner, the finally re-arm on `editSeq !== seq`, the
 * `!dirty && baseVersion === fresh.baseVersion` re-import guard, the
 * byte-equal `fresh.content === replica` reconcile, the banner and status
 * texts. Each of them is a race that was fixed once; keep them.
