/**
 * The engine contract the widget core drives — the @miragon/modeler-api
 * profile as designIQ consumes it (this core is its first consumer): import and
 * export the document TEXT, report user edits, optionally hand the canvas to
 * a Y.Text. Two invariants the lifecycle relies on:
 *
 *  1. importText never fires onDirty. The Miragon DSL renderers run
 *     commandStack.clear() inside importDSL, which EMITS 'commandStack.changed'
 *     (bpmn-js clears silently) — an adapter suppresses that echo exactly like
 *     live-client's miragon-sync does, or every load and every conflict reload
 *     would autosave a canonicalised file over the hand-authored one.
 *  2. bindLive is a CAPABILITY. Absent = the widget stays on CAS autosave —
 *     the DMN widget's deliberate mode (engines/dmn.ts); any renderer without
 *     a live-client binding mounts the same way.
 *
 * Anything a notation's extras need beyond this (bpmn: the raw bpmn-js
 * instance for todos / t.BPM; dmn: the simulator surface) rides on the
 * concrete engine type, never here.
 * Pure types: this module is imported by the node --test suites, so it must
 * never pull DOM-bound code.
