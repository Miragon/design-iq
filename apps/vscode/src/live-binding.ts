/**
 * The M1 sync layer: a two-way binding between an OPEN TextDocument and its
 * room's Y.Text — the pattern the OCT VS Code extension verified.
 *
 *  - local → shared: every document change (typing, the Miragon modeler's
 *    WorkspaceEdits, a paste) is written into the Y.Text at once as a minimal
 *    diff (updateText, sync rule 2) — no waiting for a save; save is a no-op
 *  - shared → local: a remote transaction becomes ONE WorkspaceEdit replacing
 *    the changed middle (diffRegion), so the document keeps following the room
 *    while dirty — the spike relied on VS Code's auto-revert of CLEAN files,
 *    which stops after the first local edit
 *  - the document is kept clean: a live document has no "unsaved" state, the
 *    Live Host holds the working copy — so no save prompts for others' edits
 *
 * Echo prevention and the race: local pushes carry an origin the observer
 * skips; while an inbound edit is in flight (applyEdit is async), local
 * change events are ignored — they ARE the inbound edit. A keystroke landing
 * in exactly that window shows up as a document version beyond our own edit;
 * the document is then pushed as a whole (minimal diff), so the person's text
 * wins and both sides converge. A remote edit in that same few-ms window can
 * be reverted for the peer — the accepted v1 cost, the web app's y-monaco
 * binding has no such window (Monaco edits are synchronous with Yjs).
