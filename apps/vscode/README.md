# designIQ for VS Code

[designIQ](https://github.com/Miragon/design-iq) is collaborative modeling and
architecture with AI — live, Git-native, with every model a file in your repo.
This extension brings its live models into the editor: it opens the Live Host's
model documents as `designiq://` files — the same live Y.Text the web app and
the MCP tools edit. The Miragon BPMN Modeler
(`miragon-gmbh.vs-code-bpmn-modeler`) opens them like any other `.bpmn` file;
every other notation opens as text.

## Run it (development)

Open the monorepo (or `apps/vscode`) in VS Code and press **F5** — "Run designIQ
Extension" compiles the bundle (with sourcemaps, so breakpoints land in the
`.ts` sources) and starts an Extension Development Host with your normal
extensions, the Miragon modeler included. Without the debugger:

```
pnpm --filter design-iq compile
code --extensionDevelopmentPath=$PWD/apps/vscode
```

Settings (`designiq.*`):

| Setting     | Default                 | What                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `serverUrl` | `http://localhost:8301` | The Live Host — `http(s)://` or `ws(s)://`, both work. |

A dev build from before the rename kept the URL under `bpmLive.serverUrl`; <!-- legacy-name-ok: the pre-rename settings key -->
the first start copies it to `designiq.serverUrl` (user and workspace
settings alike, never over a value already set there). Sign in again once:
the new extension id starts with an empty SecretStorage.

Commands:

- **designIQ: Open Live Model** — pick a repository (the ones you may write),
  then a model of any notation; the list shows folder, notation, who is on it
  and whether it carries unreleased changes. _Enter a path…_ at the end takes
  a repo-relative path by hand.
- **designIQ: Sign in** / **Sign in with a session token…** / **Sign out**. The
  status-bar item runs the sign-in while signed out and the open command once
  signed in.

## Sign-in

_designIQ: Sign in_ opens the host's own login (GitHub OAuth, or the SSO login
when the host has one) in your browser. The callback bounces back into this
editor through `vscode://miragon-gmbh.design-iq/auth` with a one-time code,
which the extension exchanges for its session — the one credential the host
accepts on the websocket and the REST routes. It is stored in VS Code's
SecretStorage per host URL; the browser gets no cookie, so signing out of the
web app never signs the editor out (and vice versa). Sessions last a working
day (12h); after that the next open asks you to sign in again.

Works in VS Code, Insiders, Cursor and other `vscode.env.uriScheme` editors
on the desktop; browser-hosted VS Code (vscode.dev) is not covered.

**Older hosts, or no way back into the editor:** _designIQ: Sign in with a
session token…_ takes a token by hand. Sign in to the host in your browser,
open `<host>/api/me` and paste its `wsToken` — the extension verifies it
against `/api/me`, shows you in the status bar and reconnects open documents
under that identity. The browser sign-in probes the host first and points
you here when the host has no editor sign-in yet. Whatever credential is in
use, presence shows the identity the host assigns it.

## Sync

An open document is bound two-way to its room: what you type (or the Miragon
modeler writes) goes into the shared document at once as a minimal diff, what
others change comes back as an edit into your open document — dirty or not —
and the document is kept clean, because a live document has no unsaved state
(the Live Host holds the working copy; releases go through git).

## Presence

Each open live document announces you (name, avatar, the same color as in
the web app) in the room's roster; on a `LIVE_AUTH=none` host you show up as
its local principal (`LIVE_LOCAL_USER`) — no sign-in needed there.

## Limits

- The binding keeps an open document and its room converged, but the apply
  of a remote edit is asynchronous: a keystroke landing in exactly that few-ms
  window wins locally and can revert a peer's edit from the same instant. The
  web app has no such window (Monaco edits are synchronous with Yjs).
- No Explorer tree yet: models are opened through the picker, not browsed as
  a workspace folder.

## Tests

- `pnpm --filter design-iq test` — unit tests of the sign-in, picker and
  settings helpers, and of the manifest against the ids the code relies on.
- `pnpm --filter design-iq test:e2e` — a real VS Code (downloaded once) with
  the Miragon modeler, against a running Live Host on `localhost:8301` with
  `LIVE_AUTH=none`; asserts the picker's data path, content sync both
  ways, presence and the custom editor.
