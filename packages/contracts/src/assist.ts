/**
 * "Analyse with AI" deep links — the doorway from a designIQ surface (the web
 * app, later the VS Code extension) into an AI chat whose FIRST move is this
 * connector's modeler widget: `open_modeler` (BPMN) / `open_decision_modeler`
 * (DMN) / the generated `open_<notation>_modeler` of every Miragon renderer.
 * The prompt and the URL shapes are a cross-surface contract, pinned
 * here like the wire types: the tool names must match the Live Host's `/mcp`
 * registrations, and every consumer must build the same handover.
 *
 * A prompt built here is a WORK ORDER (the `todo-prompt.ts` doctrine): the
 * receiving chat has no context, so everything rides inline — repo, model
 * path, the literal tool call, and the Live Host's MCP URL. Naming the host is
 * deliberate: a connector pointed at a DIFFERENT instance (self-hosting and
 * cell mode make several routine) then fails as a recognizable "wrong
 * instance", not as a phantom missing repo. The connector is identified by
 * that URL, never by a name: its label is whatever the user typed when adding
 * it, so a prompt that names a label sends the assistant looking for one that
 * may not exist. Model-derived text (element names) is DATA, not
 * instructions — it rides in a `fenced()` block.
 *
 * Both link targets PREFILL a chat, neither auto-submits — the user reviews
 * and sends. claude:// is documented so, with `q` truncated at ~14,000 chars
 * (the selection cap keeps prompts far below). chatgpt.com is undocumented;
 * `?prompt=` is the deliberate choice over `?q=`, which AUTO-submits — a
 * prompt that triggers tool calls gets a user review first. The URL shapes
 * live in ONE function so a provider-side change is a one-line fix.
