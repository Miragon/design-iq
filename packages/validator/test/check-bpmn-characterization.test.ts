/**
 * CHARACTERIZATION of checkBpmnXml's exact findings LIST (content + order) on
 * a nested, deliberately broken model — landed BEFORE the readBpmn refactor.
 * The DI-error block additionally pins diRequired's insertion order: ids are
 * added INLINE during the walk (node ids and flow ids interleaved at their
 * tag-key positions, the child container's o_f1 between O_task and Rule,
 * participants + messageFlow ids appended by the collaboration pass) — a
 * post-hoc reassembly from flat lists would reorder this block.
