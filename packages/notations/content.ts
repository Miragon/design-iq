/**
 * The content-repo contract (designiq.yml) — the ONE definition of "what is a
 * content repo, and what are its models", shared by every consumer that reads
 * a checkout: the Live Host, the MCP server, and the validator.
 *
 *   # designiq.yml
 *   models: processes        # or the legacy alias:  processes: processes
 *
 * A repo is a content repo iff a root designiq.yml names the folder its model
 * files live in. A model IS a file with a registered notation extension under
 * that folder (@designiq/notations); its id is the file stem (modelStem). A
 * process is the .bpmn special case, a decision the .dmn one. Nothing else
 * about the layout is assumed.
 *
 * The contract file answers to two names (CONTENT_CONFIG_FILES, in precedence
 * order): the first one that EXISTS at the root is THE config, the other is
 * not even read. Selection is by existence only — a preferred file that is
 * mid-edit or broken makes the repo "not a content repo" instead of silently
 * handing the model folder to whatever the other file says. The second name
 * is the legacy one: read forever, written never — the CLIs nudge a rename
 * (legacyContentConfigFile).
 *
 * Node-only (fs + yaml) — imported via the "@designiq/notations/content" subpath,
 * NEVER from the browser-safe package index.
