/**
 * Architecture rules (ArchUnit-style) for the designIQ workspace — run `pnpm arch`.
 *
 * Public-repo rule set (ADR 0004): identical to the pre-split config minus the
 * control-plane-specific rules — that app lives in the private overlay repo,
 * which carries its own .dependency-cruiser.mjs.
 *
 * Two rule generations live here:
 *  - TODAY rules: scoped to the current file layout, with explicit TODO(arch-N)
 *    grandfathers. The PR that moves a module DELETES its grandfather line.
 *  - HEXAGONAL rules (domain/ports/application/adapters/http): keyed to the
 *    target folders — inert until a folder exists, then enforced automatically.
