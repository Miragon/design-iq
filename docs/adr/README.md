# Architecture Decision Records

Decisions that shape the platform, with the evidence that led to them.
Format: context → decision → consequences. Superseded ADRs stay in place,
marked as such — the history is the point.

Naming: ADRs 0001–0007 predate the rename to designIQ ([ADR 0008](0008-rename-to-designiq.md))
and keep the names of their time — product, packages, image, repository and VS Code
extension appear there under their old names. ADR 0008 lists the new ones.
